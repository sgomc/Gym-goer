                    <p>The Evaluation of this Project is the Final Part of this Project in this section I will be addressing the reasons as to why my project meets the most basic needs of the end- users I surveyed in the investigation stage.</p>
                    
                    <p>The first requirement of the basic requirements is completely met as my code has more 2 analogue in-puts 2 digital outputs and 3 analogue outputs, </p>
                    <p>Moving on to the second requirement, my code fulfills this in the work out function here the Serial line “Start”, and “End” are validated before use through checking if the data contains start or end.</p>
                    <p>Then the third requirement in my code is met in multiple sections such as the people prediction section, the BMI section and the Display Estimated weight loss section.</p>
                    
                    <p>The basic requirements are all met in my code Moving on to the First advanced requirement of the code.</p>
                    
                    <p>The first advanced requirement is met as the whole code is done in Python and it utilizes 2 other data sets to taken from Kaggle and analyses them to give out an output depending on the function, then the what if questions are present in the people prediction function and the display estimated weight loss function.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Second advanced requirement both is met as what if questions contain 3 validated parameters 2 of which are of different data type.</p>
                    
                    <p>The third we advanced requirement is met as the data is graphically displayed with the use of mat-plotlib.</p>
                    
                    <p>The End users needs have all been met, every function mentioned by the end users have been created with even a bit more to feature than what they requested. </p>
                    
                    <p>To better my code I would add features such as a bit clearer heart monitor can be added to help the user monitor their heart activity while working out, with the work out function, it raises awareness for the users and their physical capabilities.</p>
                    
                    <p>More music can be added to the overall standby section to encourage self-care and lighten the mood.</p>
                    
                    <p>The radio feature of the microbit could be implemented to allow a more autonomous connection from microbit and computer or device to which is sending the data to.</p>
                    
                    <p>Pushing the activation of the workout from main dropdown menu to the csv dropdown menu </p>
                    
                    <p>These features can help improve the overall quality of the code or product of it, facilitating user-experience and bettering customers’ lives.</p>
