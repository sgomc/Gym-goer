                    <p>The part I didn’t completely explain is the micro bit Section, the micro bit has 2 serial inputs with the press A which sends a “Start” signal and press B signal which sends “End”.
                        A series an exercise from the ones created is chosen and the exercise is started. the code scrolls through the exercises in the data frame and then stores that data in a data frame, then it Shows graph-ically the amount of time spent on each exercise and stores the total amount of time taken to com-plete the exercise on another csv file for further analysis.
                        If too many exercises have been done at that hour the user will receive a few messages stating that he should take a break.
