                    <p>Planning and design are a very important section in the logistics of building and creating software, without this segment making a program from thin air would be way more complicated than its need to be. In this page I will Subdivide my program into smaller parts and give an understanding as to how I planned for this program to work.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The program I made is a Gym planner, so I subdivided it into smaller sections, specifically 3-part, Standby mode, Workout mode which Most of my modelling operates and Setting mode in which most of the data is retrieved,</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I will start with setting mode, as the first thing is to understand the Data I’m taking in and what I can do with such data, setting mode is a section which collects data such as Name (String), Sport (String) and weight (float). Which are the main points but then it further develops into asking for the type and level of exercise you want to do, storing a data set pf that type somewhere in the File in which the program is located, this data is used give advice for the type of sport you’re doing, and to create a possible list of exercises you could do.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After this comes the workout stage which contains a bit of requirements of this project and handles most of the microbit functionalities. This section is meant for actively scrolling through the selected Dataset which you’ve either personally or automatically created through the add WorkoutList Function in this project, It stores data such as time taken through the interaction of the microbit and the program. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Then comes the Standby mode which upon activation reminds the user to work out every 24 hours, so as not stress them every now and then, a Clear inspiration from duolingo , but just not as annoying.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I used a lot of technologies for this project these are, matplotlib for the graphic visualization of the analyzed data, Pandas for the a Reading and analyzing of the Csv files, then the csv module also for the storing and reading and writing in csv files that already exists, all wrapped up with Tkinter and its functionalities Simpledialog and messagebox which I used as an alternative to the print function.</p>
