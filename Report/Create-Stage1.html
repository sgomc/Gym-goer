                        <li>Focused on the bug fixing part of the program. Had some errors when I came to handling the User data in the Dataa.csv file. The true statement wouldn’t go in the right row. </li>
                        <li>Created some My multiinputDialog object class for the first inputs upon first using the code (“this is only seen if the data.csv doesn’t exists)Its a important code when it comes to my setting stage its a class object that inherits the Simpledialog functionalities to prompt the user for 3 in-puts at the same time</li>
