                    <p> Investigating in computer science is the first part that is done when engaging in computer science and software development. It is a section in which us IT people analyse the possible solutions for what needs to be done and itâ€™s the part in which we analyse the nature of it. In this page, I will Focus on what investigated at this stage of the brief and i will also Focus on the outcome of the questionnaire done to students in the context of this project. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I will start off with how I started my investigation, as ideas at this stage are as unclear as they can be, especially due to the ambiguity of the thematic for this project I decided to first explore the various potential datasets I could analyse for this project on Kaggle, I found a lot of Datasets in regard to wellbeing, but still the ideas where not as clear at this point. Then I decided to go and have a look at what applications encouraged well-being. There were a lot of home workout applications with their own personalized workout sets for every muscle in the body. So, I decided to make A Gym Planner Code for this project.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> After understanding what to do I need to understand the needs of the of the End users for this Gym planner, So I went and questioned many of my classmates who actively go to the Gym asking for their needs and what they would like to see in this code if I was supposed to make one. The List was quite Big, but I narrowed it down to a workout list maker, a workout list viewer a prediction of the amount of people they can expect at the gym at that hour and a Weight loss graph after the workout.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>With the Questionnaire done I concluded my investigation and started focusing on the design of the project.</p>
